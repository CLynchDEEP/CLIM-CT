The Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI) is the first mandatory market-based program in the United States to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. 
RGGI is a cooperative effort among the states of Connecticut, Delaware, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New York, Rhode Island, and Vermont to cap and reduce CO2 emissions from the power sector.

Following a comprehensive 2012 Program Review, the RGGI states implemented a new 2014 RGGI cap of 91 million short tons. 
The RGGI CO2 cap then declines 2.5 percent each year from 2015 to 2020. 
The RGGI CO2 cap represents a regional budget for CO2 emissions from the power sector. 

States sell nearly all emission allowances through auctions and invest proceeds in energy efficiency, renewable energy, and other consumer benefit programs. 
These programs are spurring innovation in the clean energy economy and creating green jobs in the RGGI states.
